## Usage

### Authentication

Before accessing protected routes, you need to obtain an authentication token by sending a POST request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with your credentials. The token should be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.

### Create Transaction

To create a new transaction, send a POST request to the `/api/transactions` endpoint with the transaction details in the request body. Make sure to include the authentication token in the `Authorization` header.

Example:
```bash
http
POST /api/transactions HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token
```

{
    "amount": 100.00,
    "currency": "USD"
}
#### Get Transactions
To retrieve transactions, send a GET request to the /api/transactions endpoint. You can use query parameters for pagination.

Example:
```bash
http
Copy code
GET /api/transactions?page=1&limit=10 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token
```
